Project Overview
AgriData is participating in the NASA Space Apps competition to develop an intelligent system that assists farmers and agricultural engineers in managing their farms and crops more efficiently.

 The system leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning to monitor the health of plants, detect diseases, and provide tailored recommendations for farm management. The system focuses on the following key functionalities:

1.Educational Simulation:
Objective: Educate users on the impact of irrigation, fertilizer, and pesticide decisions using real NASA weather and climate data to simulate crop growth and environmental responses.

2.Global Data Visualization:
Objective: Allow players to explore how agricultural conditions like temperature, rainfall, and soil health vary across different regions via an interactive world map.

3.Sustainability-Focused Gameplay:
Objective: Promote sustainable practices by rewarding players for making efficient water and resource management decisions, teaching conservation through interactive feedback.

Tools and Technologies

The project was developed using a modern web technology stack to ensure a responsive and interactive user experience.

•React: The primary framework used for building the entire frontend, managing game state, and creating a dynamic, component-based user interface.
•NASA POWER API: Served as the primary data source for fetching and cleaning real-world weather datasets, including rainfall, temperature, and solar radiation.
•Custom UI/CSS: Custom styling was implemented to create a unique and intuitive user experience with a NASA-inspired color palette.
•Git & GitHub: Used for version control and collaboration throughout the project's development lifecycle.
How It Works

The user experience is designed to be simple and intuitive, guiding the player through the simulation.

1.Region Selection: The user starts by selecting a country on an interactive 2D world map. This sets the environmental parameters for the simulation.

2.Data Loading: Based on the location, the system loads regional farm and climate data from the NASA POWER API.

3.Gameplay and Decision-Making: The player manages a virtual farm day-by-day, making critical decisions about irrigation, fertilizer, and pesticide application.

4.Real-Time Feedback: The game provides immediate visual feedback through dynamic bar indicators for Soil Health, Water Level, Stability, and Food Security. The crop's visual growth stage also updates to reflect the consequences of the player's actions.

Outcomes Achieved
•Functional User Interface (UI): A complete React front-end was built with a NASA-inspired visual design and live feedback indicators.

•Interactive 2D Earth Model: A simplified but functional world map was implemented for country selection.

•Core Gameplay Mechanics: The front-end simulation logic was developed to allow players to manage daily farm tasks and receive dynamic feedback.

•Data Preparation: NASA POWER data was successfully cleaned and formatted, making it ready for full integration.

Future Improvements
•Backend Integration: Connect the React interface with live backend APIs to process and serve NASA datasets in real-time.

•Enhanced Data Visualization: Display dynamic charts showing regional rainfall, temperature, and soil data within the game.

•Advanced Game Logic: Introduce event-based gameplay (e.g., heat waves, pests, floods) driven by actual climate anomalies.

•Gamification Features: Add leaderboard and user profiles to track performance and encourage engagement.
